		<h1>About My Neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
			Dugway, Utah has been in steady decline for several years.
            There used to be a bowling alley, Subway sandwich shop, movie theater, and basic lawn maintenance. However, none of these businesses had enough customers to survive long-term. This contributed to the current downward spiral, in which more and more of the people who live on-post are tired of having no amenities, and so they move to Tooele, Salt Lake City, or anywhere but here. And so more and more businesses dry up from lack of customers, until all that's left are those which are fully funded by the Air Force and not required to be self-sustaining.
            <p></p>
            Now Dugway - an always-tiny-but-once-pictureqsue community - is being slowly reclaimed by nature (except for grass and trees; the grass and trees are all dead... so it's being reclaimed by tumbleweeds, gopher mounds, and piles of antelope droppings in the middle of the deteriorating sidewalks).
        </p>
